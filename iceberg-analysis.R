# READ: plots should be saved in "plots/", with descriptive names
#       and optionally, a higher resolution, to be used in report
#       might also help to "beautify" the plots into more eye-pleasing
#       graphs, without compromising anything of importance

# Loading the csv with passenger data into "titanic" data frame

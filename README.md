# Titanic Data Analysis
## Student's Word
Our "Probability and Statistics 2" course's project regarding the use of R
and the knowledge of the course's content that we have accumulated throughout
the semester to analyse and answer the questions regarding the dataset.

## I. INTRODUCTION
The Titanic's narrative is the most common
story in the last centuries. The most passengers were killed after the ship 
collided with an iceberg and sank to the bottom of the ocean. 
It is also well-known that women and children were given higher priority 
in the lifeboats and priority was also given to first and
second-class passengers over third-class passengers. Those unlucky persons who 
did not have access to lifeboats, either drowned or froze to death in the icy water.
Although the Titanic story is tragic, it provided a great opportunity to conduct
statistical analysis and learn the numerical story of the Titanic.
Based on this, the statistical question was clear: What was the statistical effect of
lifeboat selection on the survival rate of the passengers, based on gender, age, and passenger class?
Moreover, the answer to that question helps the largest shipbuilders to take into consideration the necessary numbers
of lifeboats that must be on the ship in order to save the largest number of people. Comprehensively, this type of
thinking formed the concept of ‚Äúa natural progression toward using the data to improve estimates, forecasts, decisions,
and ultimately, efficiency‚Äù.

## III. QUESTIONS
- Download the necessary data via the [URL.]
(https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vNNtMwlHdIyQTT5ty12aOOlapp-5vM37/view?usp=share_link)
- Import the dataset (called "train.csv") into RStudio and store it in a variable called "titanic".

Q1) Provide an accurate data summary (minimum, maximum, first quantile, third quantile, median, and mean)
utilizing RStudio's built-in summary function.

Q2) In statistics, there are two main categories of variables: quantitative and qualitative. Can you explain the difference
between these two types of variables? Then, categorize the titanic data set's variables into these two categories.

Q3) In the dataset, there are 891 observations and 12 variables; some of these variables have missing data (have a
value of `NA`); answer the following concerns.
    i) Can you count the missing data in the Age variable?
    ii) Is it normal for a data set to contain missing data?
    iii) Can you provide solutions to estimate this missing data?
    iv) Indicate whether or not it will affect our statistics?

Q4) Remove these missing data using the following command >>> `titanic=na.omit(titanic)`

Q5) Draw the histogram for the dataset's Age variable.

Q6) By inspection (from the histogram), which distributions may be employed to provide a good fit for the Age and
Fare histograms?

Q7) Assuming that the 891 observations in the dataset represent the population, and that the distribution of ages is
normal, determine the true mean and standard deviation for the age variable?

Q8) Take a random sample of size 50 from Age. Using this sample, what is your point estimate of the population mean
and standard deviation?

Q9) Since you have access to the population, simulate the sampling distribution for Age by taking 50 samples from
the population of size 50 and computing 50 sample means. Store these means in a vector called sample_means50. Plot
the data, then describe the shape of this sampling distribution. Based on this sampling distribution, what would you
guess the mean age of the population to be?
